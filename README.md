# Junit

JUnit allows users to create a suite of tests that can be run throughout development.

It will save you hours of testing time on your project and provides module testing evidence for the board.

Follow the attached tutorial on JUnit. Download the code if you get stuck.

Google Test Driven Development if you would like to see how frameworks like JUnit are used in industry.
